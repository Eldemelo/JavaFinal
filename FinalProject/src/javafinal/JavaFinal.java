/* Manual/Hands-on Calculations
Salary 1:
117.23 * 10 = 1,172.30
Salary 2:
day1 = 1.15
total = 1.15
day2 = 1.15 * 2 = 2.30
total = 1.15 + 2.30 = 3.45
day3 = 2.30 * 2 = 4.60
total = 3.45 + 4.60 = 8.05
day4 = 4.60 * 2 = 9.20
total = 8.05 + 9.20 = 17.25
day5 = 9.20 * 2 = 18.4
total = 17.25 + 18.40 = 35.65
day6 = 18.4 * 2 = 36.8
total = 35.65 + 36.80 = 72.45
day7 = 36.8 * 2 = 73.6
total = 72.45 + 73.60 = 146.05
day8 = 73.60 * 2 = 147.20
total = 146.05 + 147.20 = 293.25
day9 = 147.20 * 2 = 294.40
total = 293.25 + 294.40 = 587.65
day10 = 294.40 * 2 = 588.80
total = 587.65 + 588.80 = 1,176.45
